<p>My name is Fatihah Balqis bt Shuhaimi @ Mohd Nasir and people usually called me Tiyaa. I'm 20 years old and I was born in Hospital Besar Kota Bharu, Kelantan on 9 September 2020. Currently, I am studied at UiTM Machang in Diploma in Information Management. I am cheerful and cheeky person, I loved to making jokes with my friends. My friends always call me as a naughty and happy go lucky person. I had six siblings and I am the youngest in my family. During on my free time, I like to listening music on YouTube and this had became my routine everyday. I listen to music during day and night and almost all songs in my playlist are breakup song, i am really enjoying sad and slow vibes music. I think this type of song suit my taste the most. My favourite artist is Moon Joo Won. He is actor, model and singer from South Korea and I had watched and listen all of his song. He is tall, fair skin and handsome.I loved to eat anything but my fav food is Tomyam, I loved anything about tomyam such as Tomyam Fried Rice, "bihun tomyam" and many more. I always go to food hunting around Kelantan with my bestfriend, we always trying new cafe each time hang out together. If it delicious enough, then we will repeat for the next time. We spend most of the time during holiday together. We do all of kind stupid things together, we sings, dancing and playing together until one of us become tired. However, sometimes we also had some bad days but it is okay because this is life, it has prons and cons.</p>  

<h2 style=" color: pink ".> Social Media</h2>
<p>This is the most used of my social media:
<li>Whatsapp</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Twitter </li>
<li>Tiktok</li></p>

<p>As from my experience, I started using internet when I was nine years old, it was eleven years ago. It started when my father had go to overseas due to fulfill his works for about two year in Sudan, Africa. My father bought a laptop for my family to keep in touch with him. During that time, Skype are the most popular social media that providing video calls, video chat, instant messaging services and users may transmit text, video, audio and images. Skype allows video conference
calls over the internet. Moreover, it is free and easy to use. I used to chat him every day, asking him about his day and shared mine too. We always video call twice a week. I am clearly remember my feelings at that time, I am so happy every time we are doing video call together. I started my Facebook account when I was eleven years old using a fake email account
because during that time, Facebook policy was not for children under twelve. I always got suspended by Facebook and every time I got suspended, I always create a new one again until I got the real one. Now Facebook is one of the popular global social networking website and a lot of applications needs a permission to use by using Facebook, I sign up again on 2018. I never updated my Facebook before but during this MCO, I found myself start to play it again. I started to change my profile picture and share something on it. I had Instagram account when I was thirteen years old, it was seven years ago on 2013. My hobby is to edit pictures so I always updates my Instagram feed. There a lot of pictures in my Instagram such as my pictures, my family, my friends, animal and scenery pictures. I always take picture wherever I go and it is the reason why I always like to go holiday. </p>
