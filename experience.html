<p> From my 20 years old life, some may said I am still young to be this hurt, However I had go a lot of hardship alone. There is a a lot of obstacle that I had been thru. Somedays it better and somedays it give me rainbows but I understand that everyone had their own problem, good and bad things could happen in a day. It is okay to hurt a little bit, that is a phase of growing up. Let the past be the past, and embrace tomorrow with a smile. </p>
